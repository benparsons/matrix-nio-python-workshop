# matrix-nio-python-workshop

Raw code from the workshop I gave at PyConWeb 2019 and other events

## 1 login, get response

## 2 get into a /sync loop

## 3 explore the sync response object

* maybe explore use of filters here
* focus on `sync_response.rooms.join`
* explore event objects
* isolate specific message event objects

## 4 read events

##Â 5 read messages

## 6 use `room_send`

## 7 use of /sync next_batch tokens

---

* the next section (not covered in this file)
* is to pass the message string to TensorFlow
* for sentiment analysis, then pass a number
* back
